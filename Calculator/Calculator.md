# 🧮 Console-Based Calculator

Welcome to the **Java Calculator**, a simple yet functional console-based arithmetic calculator that performs basic math operations interactively.

---

## 📋 Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Accepts two numbers from the user
- Uses methods for modular code structure
- Loop-based — supports multiple calculations until the user exits

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Run the program
2. Enter two numbers
3. Enter the desired operation symbol (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
4. View the result
5. Enter `1` to continue or `0` to exit

## 🛠 Technology Used

- Java (Standard Edition)
- Scanner for user input
- Switch-case with lambda-style (`->`) syntax
- Modular methods for each operation

---

## 🚧 Notes

- Division by zero is handled with a warning
- Case-sensitive input (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/` only)
- No complex expression evaluation (e.g., `5 + 3 * 2`)
